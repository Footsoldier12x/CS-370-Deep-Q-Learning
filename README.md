# CS-370-Deep-Q-Learning

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code given consisted of two python files, GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, which stores past games for the deep-Q algorithm to draw experience from and creates the maze environment respectively. The TreasureHuntGame.ipynb Jupyter Notebook had also most the code included for the neural network setup, with the exception of the deep-Q algorithm, which was the primary task of this project. 

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
The work that computer scientists perform can be very diverse, however, all specialties have one thing in common: problem solving. A programmerâ€™s primary task is to resolve a problem, and coding is a fantastic tool to accomplish this. The importance of computer science is seen everywhere, from 3D graphics and animation to the latest algorithms and machine learning being developed today. There are many opportunities for programmers to make an impact in nearly any industry.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Each major project I have completed has been broken down into smaller tasks that can be worked on by a single person. As that person, I must be able to work efficiently on one task at a time. This is the only way I know how to begin a project, by creating a small piece, then adding more features or components to it.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities of programmers are increasing with the advent of AI, specifically machine learning. The obscurity of the logic and methods in some algorithms, makes it easier to conceal the inner workings of a program, potentially causing harm to its users. Therefore, as part of the initial planning phase of a project, and ethical overview of the project must also be accomplished.
